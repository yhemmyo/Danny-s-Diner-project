2 How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

3 What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

4 What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

5 Which item was the most popular for each customer?

6 Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
